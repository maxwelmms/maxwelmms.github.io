Space is freed by removing temporary HMC files that are used for HMC and managed system firmware problem analysis from the HMC hard disk.  This command can free up space in the following file systems: /var, /var/hsc/log, /dump, /extra, /data, and /. The temporary files that can be removed from the /var and /var/hsc/log file systems include HMC trace and log files. The temporary files that can be removed from the /dump file system include managed system dumps, managed frame dumps, and debug data collected using the HMC pedbg command. The temporary files that can be removed from the /extra file system include managed system dumps and managed frame dumps.
